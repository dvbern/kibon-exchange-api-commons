# kiBon Exchange API Commons

This project contains DTOs and utils that are shared between kiBon and the exchange service.

These are kiBon-internal DTOs.

# Avro Schema Evolution - Dos and Don'ts
* Make sure to only edit the *.avsc files - the Java classes are automatically generated by the avro-maven-plugin
* When adding a new field, make sure to specify a `default:` value. 
When there is no default value for a field, a new consumer cannot determine the correct value for the field when parsing an old record.
* Only fields with a default value may be removed. 
Otherwise new records cannot be parsed by old consumers.
* Never rename the base `type` and `namespace`. 
The name and namespace is used by KafkaAvroDeserializer with `avro.specific.reader = true`, to generate a specific 
record instance, e.g. `VerfuegungEventDTO.class`. If a Kafka topic receives messages with another name/namespace, an
old message consumer will crash, since it doesn't contain the new class in it's class path.
